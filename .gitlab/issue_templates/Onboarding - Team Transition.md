# The issue title should be: Transition Onboarding (NAME), as (ROLE, STAGE GROUP)

-->

# Hello :wave: 

Welcome to your new team! We are happy to have you and support you! :slight\_smile:

To get you up to speed so you can start contributing to the team efforts and improving GitLab as a product, this onboarding issue will try to provide a few tips on how to navigate around the team resources.
 
If you have questions, don't hesitate to mention `@ADD HANDLE` (your [UX buddy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/uxdesigner-onboarding/#ux-design-buddy)), `@ADD HANDLE` (your Product Design Manager), or `@ADD TEAM HANDLE` (your team). 

You'll have a weekly 1:1 call with an assigned buddy until your onboarding is complete. Your onboarding doesn't have a scheduled end date, just focus on learning and getting comfortable with GitLab and your new team.

## Onboarding timeline :date: 

| Milestone | Primary focus |
| ------ | ------ |
| Add milestone |  Add assignment during the period. For example: 75% Geo & Distribution, 25% PA |
| Add milestone |  Add assignment during the period. For example: Fully transitioned to PA |

## Onboarding plan :file_cabinet: 

- It's ok to not know everything.
- Ask for help often, it is a good practice no matter how experienced you are.
- We don't expect you to pickup milestone work during your first month. Focus on onboarding!

### Your first week :smile: 

**Goal**: Get the clerical tasks out of the way and get to know your team.

##### Getting to know your team :coffee: 

Schedule coffee chats with your new team members and peers! Besides introducing yourself, during these calls you ask them how they collaborate with UX in their role, what's been working well, what can be improved, and how they would like to stay in touch. This will help you get a better idea about the team and set the expectation for how to collaborate with them. Here’s a list of people you’d like to say hello to:

- [ ] `ADD LIST OF PEOPLE (FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, ROLE`

##### Your product stage

`GROUP/STAGE NAME` has been designated your new product area, to be your focus and responsibility. Any issues related to this stage will be labeled `ADD STAGE LABEL`.

- [ ] Understand our [product hierarchy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy).

##### Complete your main onboarding task

<!--

Manager: 

Optionally, you can create an onboarding task to the transitioning team member as part of their onboarding to a new stage/group. This onboarding task can be a UX Scorecard, writing a JTBD, or setting up a specific flow/project in GitLab. The goal of the onboarding task is to provide the team member with context and hands on experience about a new problem space. 

-->

Your new manager prepared a special onboarding task to help you familiarise yourself with the new problem space you are now responsible for. During your first month with the new team, you should focus on solving a high-level problem instead of picking up milestone deliverables.

## Remember to practice self-care

Make sure you take breaks if you feel overwhelmed or tired, especially if this is your first remote job. Remember stretch your legs, drink some water, and disconnect when necessary. Try to establish a healthy routine that will empower you to work in a way that enables you to deliver the best results.
