## Hello  :wave:
Welcome to the UX Department!

We have created this issue to help you become immersed in your role as a Product Design Manager.

##### Getting questions answered
If you have questions, don't hesitate to @mention your UX buddy, `@tauriedavis or @mvanremmerden` (your Manager), or the whole UX department by using `@gitlab\\-com/gitlab\\-ux` (use the latter sparingly unless it's something important). You can also reach out to people in the `#ux` Slack channel.

##### Onboarding expectations
Your onboarding doesn't have a scheduled end date. Just focus on getting comfortable with GitLab and getting to know your colleagues.

#### Company
GitLab is a special place with a unique culture. We document everything. Most of the information you will ever need is available in the GitLab [handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/). We view it as our single source of truth (SSOT).

###### Company structure
* [ ] First, it's likely that you want to know where your place is in the company structure. For this, you can check out the [GitLab org chart](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/). This is a good page to bookmark.
* [ ] The company uses [OKRs](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/okrs/) to set goals and track progress.

###### Getting started
* [ ] Understanding GitLab's [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) is really important. Our values describe the type of behavior that we expect from the people that we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making, they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.
* [ ] [Learn how we communicate as a company](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/). We use asynchronous communication as a start and are as open as we can be by communicating through public issues, chat channels, and placing an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.
* [ ] When setting up your home office, get advice and guidance about what you might need and what you can expense by checking out the [spending company money page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/).
* [ ] Finally, the [general guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines/) will help you understand how we get things done.

###### Vacation
[Time away from work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/) is important and helpful for maintaining a healthy work/life balance. As a leader, you set an example for taking appropriate time away and ensuring your direct reports do the same.

If you are planning to be on vacation for a day or longer, please communicate your time off by:
* Updating [PTO by Deel](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#time-off-by-deel) in Slack and changing your Slack status.
* Updating your [status](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#current-status) in GitLab.
* Updating the [UX calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV85cHNoMjZmaGEzZTRtdmhscmVmdXNiNjE5a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
* Updating your personal calendar. If you use Google's `Out of Office` event feature, any meetings that are scheduled for when you are out of office will be auto-declined.
* Notifying your manager in your 1:1 meeting.

You should communicate your time off for public holidays (since they differ depending on where you are in the world!).
You don't need to worry about taking an hour or two off to go to the gym, take a nap, go grocery shopping, do household chores, etc.

The same applies to your direct reports. They should use the above methods when taking time off. In addition, they should notify you in your 1:1 meeting.

#### UX Department
Each department has its own handbook section, and UX is no exception:
* [ ] Read through the whole [UX handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/) section, please! Consider this your first team task, understanding the Mission, Vision, and how work is executed within the department. If you find any typos or items that could be made clearer, please consider submitting a merge request.
* [ ] Read about [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/), our design system.
* [ ] Become familiar with the role responsibilities for each level within Product Design - [Product Designer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/product/product-designer/#product-designer), [Senior Product Designer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/product/product-designer/#senior-product-designer), [Staff Designer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/product/product-designer/#staff-product-designer), [Principal Product Designer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/product/product-designer/#principal-product-designer), and your role, [Product Design Manager](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/product/product-design-management/#product-design-manager).
* [ ] Review [product operations in the product handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-operations/) and ask questions in the #product-operations or #product Slack channels to get clarification on things you are uncertain about.
* [ ] *Optional* Attend [PM Meeting bi-weekly and Product Operations bi-weekly meetings](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#team-meetings) (they alternate and are on the company calendar)
* [ ] Review and bookmark the [Product Design Manager Workflows handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/product-design-manager.html).


##### Getting to know people
* [ ] Schedule weekly 1:1s with your direct reports. Most of your directs will have an existing agenda in Google docs that they used with their previous manager. Request access to this document, or create a new doc, and attach it to the 1:1 invite. The agenda is a great place for each of you to add items for discussion and to take notes on any decisions or action items.
* [ ] Schedule coffee chats with other members of the UX department to get to know who you work with. Talk about everyday things. We want you to make friends and build relationships with the people you work with to create a more comfortable, well-rounded environment.
* [ ] Consider joining the `#random-coffees-ux-dept` Slack channel to randomly pair with someone new once every two weeks.
* [ ] Schedule regular coffee chats with your Product Manager and Engineering Manager partners. Introduce yourself and get to know each other, since they will be some of your key contacts.
* [ ] If you want to bring something to the attention of all UX Department members, you can ping `@uxers` on Slack, email: `ux-department@gitlab.com` or mention `@gitlab\-com/gitlab\-ux` within GitLab (please use all forms sparingly unless it's something important).

##### Getting to know the product
Optional: If you'd like to learn more about the product outside your stage, the Sales org has created a series of excellent overviews around who uses GitLab and how they benefit from it. Learning about the product from the perspective of benefits will help you understand JBTD. Feel free to bookmark these and dive deeper after you feel more comfortable.

#### Sharing a little about yourself
* [ ] GitLab team members use README.md files to share information about themselves. It’s another way to get to know someone, how they work, and what they enjoy. Create your own personal README.md. It’s up to you what you wish to share. For inspiration, take a look at the [UX Team's README's](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/#about-our-team).

##### Keeping track of everything
* [ ] You also have a ["To Do" list](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/todos?nav_source=navbar). Issues you are assigned to or mentioned on will show up here until you mark them as done.

###### Staying informed
* [ ] There are over 1000 Slack channels at GitLab. You can join as many as you like! However, you may find the following channels most useful at first: `#git-help`, `#peopleops`, `#product`, `#questions`, and `#ux`. Each stage group also has a Slack channel. Each stage group channel normally starts with the letter 'g'. For example, the Secure stage group channel is `#g_secure`. Join `#managers` for manager-related topics and announcements.
* [ ] There is usually a [group conversation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/group-conversations/) every Monday through Thursday. Group Conversations are a way for departments and stage groups to keep the wider business informed about what they are currently working on.
* [ ] We have a [UX Weekly Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189WZO7uTlZCznzae2gqLqFn55koNl3-pHvU-eVnvG9c/edit) every Tuesday.
* [ ] We have a weekly [UX Leadership meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189WZO7uTlZCznzae2gqLqFn55koNl3-pHvU-eVnvG9c/edit) every Monday.
* [ ] We have an early/late `UX Hangout` call once every two weeks. This is where members of the UX Department can meet informally to talk about anything they want.
* [ ] You will have a weekly 1:1 meeting with your manager. This meeting is for you! Please take a moment before your 1:1s to add items to the agenda. This can be anything from an update on what you are working on to questions and concerns about the team, company, etc.
* [ ] Your manager is here to support you! If you need a 1:1 chat at any time, book some time on their calendar or DM on Slack.
* [ ] You are not obligated to attend any of the meetings that you are invited to. However, please notify others of your absence by responding to Google calendar invites. If you do not attend a meeting, please read the agenda items and go through the notes of the meeting. Also, check whether there is a recording available.
* [ ] Recordings can be found on [GitLab Unfiltered Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A), [GitLab Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg), and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FLKOVDqiD7lMn11gvaVE8P4wWPf3FwFM). The meetings in Google Drive are organized in folders by meeting name.



##### Your onboarding experience
This issue is confidential by default, meaning this is a safe space to ask any questions and to describe any experiences you might have had. It's a tool to help **you** succeed!

Please share your newfound knowledge! The rest of the UX Department would love to hear your experiences. You are in a position to help make things better for everyone (colleagues, new teammates, etc), including you.

Within this issue, please let us know how we can improve the onboarding experience. Please keep notes on what went well, what didn't go well, or what you feel could be improved. We'll use your feedback to improve the onboarding experience for future people who join the team.

* [ ] If your Manager hasn't done so on your behalf, please add yourself to the next [UX weekly meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_t6Oq4vqwA2eHPaXx0H6HkZiZ4um_lWHsqJIDstnEE/edit#heading=h.vzi4q225n0pu) and spend 3-5 minutes max in total sharing a summary of your experience with the team.

#### Closing thoughts
Taking in a lot of information can quickly feel overwhelming. This is normal and you are encouraged to ask questions at any time. Embrace knowing nothing and you'll take it in as you go. Take your time to work through your onboarding tasks; you are not expected to be at 100% productivity right away! And remember: if you are here, it's because you are the best person we have found in the world (literally) to do this job.

Working remotely comes with great power and great responsibility. A member of the UX team wrote a [helpful article on being efficient and productive](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/05/17/eliminating-distractions-and-getting-things-done/).

##### Remember to practice self-care
Make sure you take breaks if you feel overwhelmed or tired, especially if this is your first remote job. Remember to stretch your legs, drink some water, and disconnect when necessary. Try to establish a healthy routine that will empower you to work in a way that enables you to deliver the best results.
