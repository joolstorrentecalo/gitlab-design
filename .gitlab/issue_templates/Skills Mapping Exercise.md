Title should be: Skills Mapping Exercise Q1 {{YEAR}}
(e.g. "Skills Mapping Exercise - Q1FY25")
-->

Each year in Q1 we ask product designers to self-assess their skills. The primary goal of the skills analysis is to inform individual team member’s growth plans. Secondary benefits are that it allows us to see our strengths as a team, helps to identify team trainings that would benefit a large portion of the team, helps us identify strengths we’d like to add when hiring new team members and can also act as a resource for matching mentors and/or design pairs. This issue kicks off the process.

The handbook section with the full process is [here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/product-design-manager/#team-skills-matrix)
