<!-- Issue Title: MANAGER NAME's reports: FY2X-QX Talent Assessment 
     Example: Rayana's reports: FY24-Q4 Talent Assessment -->

# Overview

GitLab has launched the annual Talent Assessment process. This issue is going to be used to track `@MANAGER`'s reports participation in the process. Please review [the handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) for more information and check the additional [resources](#resources) below.

## :one: Team member self-evaluations

Team member self-evaluations will open officially on `YYYY-MM-DD` and are due on `YYYY-MM-DD`. 

* :island: If you have time-off scheduled, please make sure your self-assessment is done _before_ `YYYY-MM-DD`.

During this period, you'll complete a Performance Factor Worksheet and a self-evaluation through Workday. Each team members' worksheets are linked below.

**Please Check off your name once you've completed the self-assessment in the worksheet and Workday:**

### ðŸ’¬ Tips for completing a self-evaluation

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

* :clock: The performance period covers everything since the last Talent Assessment (so think last October â€“ this October). For example, you can pull in content from the Mid-Year Check-In, Discretionary Bonus, Team Retrospectives, and manager 1:1 doc.
* :pencil: Performance factor worksheet
    * In your worksheet, include examples for each job responsibility. Add links to GitLab issues or other artefacts that can help support your examples. Instead of linking to Slack threads, take a screenshot and link it to the sheet. 
    * Include the "why" for your examples. Think: why is that a highlight for you and how does it tie in with your role, your goals or your personal growth areas?
    * Remember that quality of examples is better than quantity.
    * Optionally, you can check "Performance Factor" rating checkbox next to each row to highlight an achievement, strength, or opportunity.
        * These checked items can be used to help streamline what you want to copy over to Workday (see below for details).
* ðŸ’¾ Workday
    * You'll be asked to list 3 most recent, significant achievements aligned with the job responsibilities and expectations of the role. Don't worry about writing paragraphs of text in every single row. 2-3 strengths and 2-3 opportunities TOTAL with 2-3 examples each is sufficient. You should be able to reuse (aka copy/paste) from your worksheet.
    * Functional Competencies as well as Manager and Leadership Competencies only apply to Staff+ roles.
    * See this :link: [Workday Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdGDq85nY3uLRFLrmKV5RDyQpGkPmnvGAI1pN_RRNto/edit) in case you want a preview of what Workday looks like.

**Please note that the Workday is the SSOT for Talent Assessment information and documentation**.

## :two: Manager evaluation cycle

Between `YYYY-MM-DD` until `YYYY-MM-DD`, Managers complete an evaluation and Performance/Growth Potential ratings for their reports.

## :three: Workday calibration

Between `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYY-MM-DD`, all Managers will meet to [calibrate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#calibration-session) performance across the department.

## :four: Communicate final assessment

Between `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYY-MM-DD`, managers can communicate Performance/Growth Potential assessment to their reports. This will be done during a 1:1 call.
