## Intent

This issue describes how team members help each other take meaningful [time away from work][pto]. The goal is for those taking PTO to not feel like they need to "catch up" before and after [taking a well-deserved vacation][time-off]. 

## :handshake: Responsibilities

<!-- List the priorities that the responsible backups need to cover. Backups can be a peer, your manager, or a peer/manager in a different department (e.g. product manager).

Responsibilities include reviewing Community Contribution merge requests, responding to UX-related questions, providing feedback related to inflight development work, or responding to Slack inquiries. -->
