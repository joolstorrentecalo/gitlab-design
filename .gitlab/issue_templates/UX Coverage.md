## Intent

This issue describes how broader group and team members are facilitating a Product Designer to take meaningful time away from work. The intent is that the designer isn't required to "catch-up" before and after [taking a well-deserved vacation][time-off]. 

## :handshake: Responsibilities

List the priorities that the responsible backups need to cover. Backups can be another product designer, your design manager, or product manager.

Responsibilities include reviewing merge requests, responding to UX related questions or providing feedback related to inflight development work, responding to Slack inquiries. [See all responsibilities in the Handbook][responsibilities]

| Priority | Responsibility | Context Link | Primary backup DRI | Secondary backup DRI |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| `HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` | `e.g. Reviewing merge requests` | `ADD LINK` | `@assignee` | `@assignee` | 

<!--- 

Optionally, you can use the following priority badges:

- HIGH: [![Priority badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Priority-High-red.svg)](https://shields.io/)
