## Intent

This issue describes how broader group and team members are facilitating a members of the UX Department to take meaningful time away from work. The intent is that the folks aren't required to "catch-up" before and after [taking a well-deserved vacation][time-off]. 

## :handshake: Responsibilities

List the priorities that the responsible backups need to cover. Backups can be a peer, your manager, or a peer/manager in a different department (e.g. product manager).

Responsibilities include reviewing merge requests, responding to UX related questions, providing feedback related to inflight development work, or responding to Slack inquiries.

| Priority | Responsibility | Link | Primary backup DRI | Secondary backup DRI |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| `HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` | `e.g. Reviewing merge requests` | `ADD LINK` | `@assignee` | `@assignee` | 

## :muscle: Coverage Tasks

Include specific issue links for tasks to be completed by your backups.

- [ ] `Item` - `Link` - `@assignee`

## ðŸš™ Parked tasks

List the larger responsibilities that aren't moving forward until I return, such as creating a prototype or planning/conducting research.
