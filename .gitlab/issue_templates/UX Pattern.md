### Pattern checklist

Make sure these are completed before closing the issue,
with a link to the relevant commit, if applicable.

1. [ ] Ensure that you have broken things down into atoms, molecules, and organisms.
1. [ ] Check that you have not created a duplicate of an existing pattern.
1. [ ] Ensure that you have used the proper method for creating the pattern depending on the complexity. Atoms and molecules are symbols, organisms are groups.
1. [ ] Make sure that typography is using text styles. When applicable used shared styles for colors.
1. [ ] QA check by another UXer
1. [ ] Add changes to gitlab-elements.sketch
1. [ ] Add a merge request that includes any new or updated guidelines to the [GitLab Design System](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com)
1. [ ] Add an agenda item to the next UX weekly call to inform everyone (if new pattern, not yet used in the application)
