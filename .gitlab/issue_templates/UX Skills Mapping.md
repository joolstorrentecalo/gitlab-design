<!-- Issue title: UX Skill Matrix - MANAGERâ€™s reports -->

* Product Design Manager: `@MANAGER_HANDLE`
* UX team: `TEAM/SECTION NAME`

## Overview

From time to time we like product designers to [assess their UX skills](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/product-design-manager/#team-skills-matrix). This is so that we have an updated view of everyone's top strengths and can assess interest in learning new skills.

We will use the output of the UX Skills Matrix in a few different ways:

* Identify learning opportunities - for example, if a lot of designers want to improve their communication, we could look into a book club or class to take together
* Hiring managers can use it as a guide for skills to look for when hiring
* Team members can use it as part of their career growth

### Is this another Talent Assessment?

No - it's a self-assessment of your design skills now, and where you'd like them to be in the future. 

You might use your Talent Assessment (TA) as an input to it if you'd like, but this isn't about assessing performance in the role. It's also different from TAs, in that it's shared with the team, where a TA is private. Sharing it helps everyone see where the strengths are in the team, so they can learn from others.
