## Overview 

UX Themes are comprehensive bundles of work organized around the user problem, their need, and their desired outcome. UX Themes comprise a team's UX Roadmap, which should act as a single source of truth for a team's North Star UX vision serving as the blueprint for their strategy. In essence, themes are a wrapper that looks at all the individual issues a Group may have and organizes them into relational bundles, allowing solutions to be holistic and non-fragmented. A UX Roadmap is simply the prioritization of these UX Themes based on user and business needs while also considering your team's confidence in the supporting data.
