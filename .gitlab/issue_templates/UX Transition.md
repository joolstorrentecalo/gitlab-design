## Context

This issue is dedicated to the seamless transition of responsibilities for `_ STAGE GROUP, GROUP, OR CATEGORY_` from `_YOUR HANDLE_` to `_NEWLY ASSIGNED DRI HANDLE_`.

However, it is encouraged to partner closely with Product Management, UX leadership, and stage group counterparts to provide the necessary information for a seamless transition.
