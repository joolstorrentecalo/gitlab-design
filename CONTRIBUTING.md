## Contribute to GitLab

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitLab. This guide details how
to contribute to GitLab in a way that is efficient for everyone.

## Figma for GitLab

### Why Figma?

We’ve been drawn to Figma because it aligns with our *everyone can contribute* mantra. Figma’s free version is full-featured (outside of what you may get from Team or Organization accounts), and you can use it on nearly any platform/device. File management and sharing is a breeze without the need for a repository. Commenting and sharing is seamless and does not require additional tools or paid accounts to participate. All of these capabilities make it easier for anyone to contribute.

### Library structure

TODO: Add how Figma is structured and utilized for stage teams

## Code of conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests,
updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other
activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual
language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public
or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not
follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be
reported by emailing `contact@gitlab.com`.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org),
version 1.1.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/).
