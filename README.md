## About

This project is primarily used by [GitLab’s UX Design department][ux-handbook] to 
facilitate cross stage design collaboration. To learn about how we use Figma,
our UI design tool, read the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). For
more information about the UX Design department, read the [Links](#links)
section.

### Goals

- Facilitate cross stage design collaboration.
- Enable frequent, stable, and consistent contributions.
- Make GitLab’s design open, transparent, and open source.
- Facilitate design handoffs and design–development communication design handoffs.

## Contributing

GitLab is an open source project and we are very happy to accept community
contributions.
