## Repository SUPERPOWERS :stars:

- Automatic Sketch previews based on a pre-commit hook

*The pre-commit hook will auto generate preview images out of your Sketch pages with sketchtool*

- Semi automatic Sketch spec previews with Continuous Integration

*Whenever you create a spec preview folder with the [Sketch Measure Plugin](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure), append `spec-previews` to the name of the generated directory and it will be visible by an URL. Search in [https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-design)

### Activating them!

1. Have a Mac with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) installed in the /Applications folder
2. Copy the `pre-commit` file into your `.git/hooks/` folder

    - *[Issue for Autogenerated Sketch Previews Discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/15)*
4. Install [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/)
5. Install [Sketch Measure Plugin](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure) with the Sketch Toolbox
3. Read on :)

## Commit Workflow

As design files are mostly binary files, merge conflicts can easily get stuck in conflicts. We will do the file merging manually instead of git.

### Personal Folders

1. In the `progress` directory, create your own folder
2. In your own folder, create a subfolder for each issue/project you are working on
3. Commit & Push changes

### Production Folders

1. [Lock file](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/file_lock.html)
2. Pull changes
3. Add our changes to the file
4. Commit & Push changes
5. [Unlock](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/file_lock.html) file

## Naming Convention
*TODO: We should write a pre-commit hook that checks for this naming convention, both in and outside sketch.*

### Everywhere

- Readability above truncation, so: `background` instead of `bg`
- `lowercase` __everywhere__
- separate words with hyphens, _no-spaces-everywhere__

### Files & Folders

- for each issue create subfolders for issues

### Layers & Groups (inside Sketch)

- Try to adhere to [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/) like so: block-element__modifier

Example:

- `navigation-1__project`

- if you need to add the modifier, you can: `navigation-1__project--issues`

*[Issue for Layer/Group Naming Convention Discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/13)*

## Sketch Management

- Please try to use the [Symbol Resizing](https://blog.sketchapp.com/sketch-39-brings-symbol-resizing-and-cloud-beta-a74d3aa0611a#.rcu9qt4er) feature, when creating symbols
- Add hidden *full red* (#FF0000) blocks, for important paddings and margins.

## Delivery

All designs mockups and details are delivered in the issue that describes the feature/problem/etc. So there is one place to look for everything related to it.

## Designer & Developer Communication

> Designers and developers often have different priorities, even though everyone is working toward one common goal: a fantastic, delightful, functional product. At Google, we're always working on ways to bridge this gap through unified spec formats and tools, so that intricate details are never lost in translation and things get done the way they're intended the first time - [Designer & Developer Communication Google IO 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFyK1J5NrVk)

Spec previews can be generated with the one of the [SUPERPOWERS](#GitLab-Design-Kit)!

When additional detail is needed, developers will ask for this. Take inspiration out of the link above if needed.

## Archive

The archive directory contains all old design files and resources, including those made with [Antetype](http://www.antetype.com/).

Old Antetype design files can still be valuable, if so see: [Converting antetype files for use with sketch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19864)

## Design goals

- Get the user started with all already existing materials
- Try to kickstart design work while avoiding time lost on creating the duplicate content
- Let designers contribute in a stable and consistent manner
