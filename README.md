## About

**GitLabâ€™s open source pattern library, prototypes, and work-in-progress files.**

This project is primarily used by [GitLabâ€™s UX Design team][ux-handbook] to host design
files and hand them off for implementation. To learn about the best
practices to manage this project, including the repositoryâ€™s organization,
check out the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). For more information
about the UX Design team, check out the [Links](#links) section.

### Goals

- Jumpstart design work by using the pattern library and previous work
- Enable frequent, stable, and consistent contributions
- Make GitLabâ€™s design open, transparent, and open source
- Facilitate design handoffs and designâ€“development communication design handoffs.

## Getting started

**If youâ€™re a GitLab Inc. engineer**: you shouldnâ€™t have to clone this project,
ever. Instead, ask the UX designer for the specs of the designs youâ€™re working with.

**If you want to browse and contribute**:

1. The UX Design team primarily uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). See [Software](/CONTRIBUTING.md#software) for information on using alternatives.
1. Install and enable [Git Large File System (LFS)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/30/getting-started-with-git-lfs-tutorial/):
   1. Install with [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) via `brew install git-lfs` or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) via `port install git-lfs`
   1. Enable with `git lfs install`
   - If you use a [Git GUI client](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac) (e.g. Tower) instead of the command line, look in the docs/manual of your app to see how you can install/enable Git LFS
1. Refer to the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing

Git LFS currently tracks the following file extensions on the repository:
`.atype`, `.sketch`, `.psd`, `.zip`, `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`.
An [archive of the repository before using Git LFS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design-archive)
was created on July 8, 2017.
