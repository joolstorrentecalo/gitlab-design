## About

**GitLab Sketch UI Kit, prototypes, and work-in-progress files.**

This project is primarily used by [GitLab‚Äôs UX Design team][ux-handbook] to host design
files and hand them off for implementation. To learn about the best
practices to manage this project, including the repository‚Äôs organization,
check out the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). For more information
about the UX Design team, check out the [Links](#links) section.

### Goals

- Jumpstart design work by using the GitLab Sketch UI Kit and previous work
- Enable frequent, stable, and consistent contributions
- Make GitLab‚Äôs design open, transparent, and open source
- Facilitate design handoffs and design‚Äìdevelopment communication design handoffs.

## Getting started

**If you‚Äôre a GitLab Inc. engineer**: you shouldn‚Äôt have to clone this project,
ever. Instead, ask the UX designer for the specs of the designs you‚Äôre working with.

**If you want to browse and contribute**:

1. The UX Design team primarily uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). See [Software](/CONTRIBUTING.md#software) for information on using alternatives.
1. If you're a wider community member, unfortunately, we can only accept contributions to our [Sketch UI Kit](/doc/sketch-ui-kit.md). Please follow the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-wider-community-contributors-) in order to do so. If you want to share Sketch files you have created for certain issues, we invite you to share them inside of the issue as a comment attachment.
1. If you're a GitLab team member or you just want to clone for local inspection:
    1. Install and enable [Git Large File System (LFS)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/30/getting-started-with-git-lfs-tutorial/) through the command line:
        1. Install with [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) via `brew install git-lfs` or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) via `port install git-lfs`
        1. Enable with `git lfs install` (If you use a [Git GUI client](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac) (e.g. Tower) instead of the command line, look in the docs/manual of your app to see how you can install/enable Git LFS)
        1. Check that it‚Äôs installed with `git lfs --version`. The output should mention your installed version (e.g. `git-lfs/2.9.0`).
    1. To access the contents inside of this repository you have two options:
        1. Clone this repository locally with `git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design.git`. Remove `--depth 1` if you want to clone the repository including all history. 
        2. Browse and upload to the repository through the web UI. Please read the [contribution guidelines for community contributors](/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-wider-community-contributors-) for more information.
    1. Refer to the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.

Git LFS currently tracks the following file extensions on the repository:
`.atype`, `.sketch`, `.psd`, `.zip`, `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`.
An [archive of the repository before using Git LFS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design-archive)
was created on July 8, 2017.
