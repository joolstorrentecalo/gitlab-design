## Plugins

Before getting started with the pattern library, install the
[recommended plugins](/CONTRIBUTING.md#plugins).

## Structure

We use the [atomic design methodology](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
to break components down into different levels. Within our [pattern library][pattern-library-file]
we separate them using atoms, molecules, and organisms.

When building components, apply [constraints](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/layer-basics/constraints/)
to all the layers in symbols and groups.

### Atoms

Atoms are the smallest [_symbols_](#symbols), the building blocks that cannot
be broken down further. They consist of what would be HTML tags, including forms,
labels, inputs, icons, and buttons. Generally, atoms should live as global
components to be reused elsewhere.

### Molecules

Molecules are [_symbols_](#symbols) containing atoms. Besides atoms, they can
also have regular layers. They form functional components and are the basis of
the design system.

### Organisms

Organisms are _groups_ containing atoms and molecules. Besides these symbols,
they can also have regular layers. These help shape the final design of the
interface. By building organisms from atoms and molecules, we encourage
assembling reusable components. This allows designers to manipulate organisms
for their designs, as well as find and use [symbol overrides](#overrides).

#### Atomic design example

The issuable sidebar breaks down components using the atomic methodology. The
collapsed sidebar uses labels and icons as atoms. When put together, we create
the organism from two types of molecules: _icon tabs_ and _icon + label tabs_.

## Symbols

Our [pattern library][pattern-library-file] takes advantage of [symbols](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/),
[nested symbols](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/nested-symbols/), and
[overrides](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/editing-symbols/#overrides)
to make updating components as easy as possible. Symbols can use overrides to
switch between states, colors, text, and more. For an example of a symbol that
uses various types of overrides, look at our _Label + Input_ symbol:

![Label + Input symbol with its overrides panel in Sketch](images/symbol-overrides.png)

### Overrides

We‚Äôve built out symbols using visual cues that show when and where a component
can be overridden. To make overrides visually distinctive, follow these guidelines:

‚Ü™

When an override is nested under another override, preface the layer name with
‚Ü™. This will make it easy to see that the override will apply to the override
above it. A common example of this is text within an input or the color of an icon.

üí°

When an override changes the state of the component, preface the layer name with
üí°. This will make it easy to see that the override will apply a state change.
A common example of this is when applying a hover or active state to a component.

üé®

When an override changes the color of the component, preface the layer name with
üé®. This will make it easy to see that the override will apply a color change.
A common example of this is changing the color of a background or icon.

## Icons

### 1. Prepare your icon

1. Make sure your icon is no larger than `14px x 14px` and is centered on a `16px x 16px` artboard that has no background.
1. Create a symbol of your icon and name it following the naming convention: `icn/[icon-name]` 
1. Ensure your icon was designed using `#000000` as the only  fill color.
1. Remove any layer styles that might be applied to your icons.

### 2. Add your icon to the pattern-library

1. Paste icon into `gitlab-pattern-library.sketch` in the icons page. You can place it in the last row, or if the row is complete, start a new row. It should look like this at this point:

![import-icon](images/import-icon.png)

2. Copy and paste the masked override layer from another icon in the page into your icon group.

![paste-layer-mask](images/copy-paste-layer-mask.png)

3. Mask your shape with the override layer. This will create a group and rename your shape layer to mask.

![result-with-mask](images/result-with-mask.png)

4. Move both the shape and the masked override outside the group folder and delete the now empty group folder. Rename the layer to `Shape` from `Mask`.

5. Save the file with your new icon added. üëç

### 3. Add your icon to the instance-sheet

1. Your icon should now be a symbol and ready to add to the instance sheet. Open the `gitlab-instance-sheet.sketch`file and find alphabetically where your symbol belongs. Add it to the end of the row or start a new row if there is no space.
1. Align your icon with the other icons in the sheet both vertically and horizontally.
1. Save the changes you made to the file. üëç

### 4. Commit and push your changes
And now your icon is ready to use! üéâ üí™

## Font family

While GitLab uses system fonts, our pattern library makes use of the Helvetica
Neue font family. Helvetica Neue is one our fall back fonts within our font stack
and is readily available on all Mac systems.

San Francisco is often recommended as an alternative because it is the macOS
font and it is available for download. However, due to [license restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)#cite_ref-Apple_Developer_Fonts_3-2),
we are unable to use it within our pattern library.
