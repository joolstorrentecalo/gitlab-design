Current Issues:
(in order of priority/ milestone)
- UX Discovery: WAF interface improvements (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13555 (Milestone: 12.4)
    Concerns: I don't know how or where to get started on either of these! I sent Andy some Slack messages about my questions/ concerns/ potential strategies on Tues so I'll wait to see what he says. But the technical side of things is wildly intimidating at the moment.

- Defend Product Foundations Document (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/547)
    which will influence: Defend UX Page (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/548)

Issues to keep on my radar:
- Add configuration section to Security and Compliance nav (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13646#note_205928144). This will apply to Defend as it will also need a configuration section that matches this one.
- Improve day 1 and setup UX for Secure features (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13638)
- Discuss Secure approach to dashboards strategy and frameworks (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/13642#note_205199185)
    Design feedback session (Kyle) on onboarding/ zero state dashboards: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp7mMLcmxDUB51_wQ9koIXYpK5p31Usg/view

Notes:
- Consider talking to Sam (in the future, as Defend ramps up) about how we'd like to work and cadence of meetings/ syncs re: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/551
