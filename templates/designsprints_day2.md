# Welcome to the Day 2 

In the Sketch phase, the Design Sprint team generates and shares a broad range of ideas. First, each participant will individually generate ideas to then narrow down the ideas as a group to single, well articulated solution.

## Day 2 Homework 

A walkthrough of the Day 2 Homework can be found [here](video link), or if you'd rather you can read through [the slides](slide deck link).

### Note Recap (5 Minutes)

The first step is to gather all the data, and reground yourself in what you have learned. 

**Instructions:**

- Review all the notes that were taken during Day 1.
- Review all the HMW stickies to jog your memory.					

### Ideas List (5 Minutes)

Make a list of all possible solutions to the opportunities that were formed in Day 1. What solutions will bring us to our goal? 

**Instructions:**
	
- On a piece of paper just jot down any solutions that come to mind around solving HMW statements.	

### Crazy 8's (8 Minutes)

A fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch out 8 ideas in 8 minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge. These are rough sketches, as we practiced yesterday. No need for perfection. 

**Instructions:**
	
- Grab your printer paper and create an 8 panel page by folding your paper in half 3 times.
- Draw a sketch for an idea in each rectangle.
- Start at the top of your ideas list.
 
### Share Out Prep (10 Minutes)

After everyone has finished the Crazy 8s exercise, it’s time for each team member to share the ideas they have generated with the group.

**Instructions:**
	
- In preparation for our share out tomorrow, take a photo of your Crazy 8 paper and add it to the following [FigJam](FigJam link). 

#### Day 2 Async Tasks are due by `Add Date and Time`. When you’ve completed these steps, please mark this [issue comment](issue comment link) with a green check and ensure your Crazy 8 Drawings are put into the FigJam. 

Refer to this chart to see due dates in specific timezones. :point_down:

## Day 2 Sync Activities

### Share Out & Dot Voting 		

Each person will have two minutes to present their ideas to the team. 
After each team member has gotten the chance to present their ideas, we will do a round of dot voting.

### Storyboarding	

A Storyboard maps out each step of the experience and forces the team to think about some smaller connecting pieces in the experience that you may need to prototype.
