# Welcome to the Day 3 

On day 3, we will aim to create a prototype that is just real enough to test out hypothesis. We can create paper prototypes, use prototyping software to create one or even write a code snippet to try your ideas out. There is no need to build a full functional back-end or to solve for every flow in your product.	

The Designer (@ username) will craft out a prototype based on the storyboard for the team to review. The prototype pages will be posted the [FigJam](FigJam Link) when this step is done. **Please note, this step will be completed before `Add Date and Time`.** 

### Day 3 Homework - Prototype feedback (Monday, June 12th)

Once the designer has completed the prototype, the team will review it and leave feedback.

**Instructions (10 Minutes):**

- Each page of the prototype will be posted in the [FigJam](FigJam Link) under the prototyping section. 
- Each team member will review the FigJam and leave sticky notes for comments, questions and concerns. 
     - Please try to avoid feedback around the pixel-perfection of the UI as this is just a basic low-fi prototype. 
- These sticky notes can be for the entire page, or just a section of the page. 

Because we will be going into a round of hallway testing right away, there will be only time for one round of feedback from the Sprint Team. There will be more time for the prototype to be adjusted and feedback to be given before we jump into proper user testing later in the month. 

### Day 3 Homework - Find internal users to test with (Date)

Working in groups of two next week, you will conduct interviews with internal team members to gather feedback on the prototype. We will aim for 3 interviews total, but if you want to do more feel free. Never conducted a user interview before? Don't worry, we'll be working on the testing script together in the next sync session. 
 
In preparation for this, we'll want to get a casual 30 minute interview scheduled next week after our sync session with someone at GitLab. These interviews should be conducted with personas that typically use the (feature name) such as:

<!-- Select personas from the list:

Once a group has an interview scheduled, add it to the table below:

| Interviewers | Who is being interviewed | When is the interview scheduled | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `@username` `@username`  |    `@username`    |    `Date`    |
| `@username` `@username`  |    `@username`    |    `Date`    |
| `@username` `@username`  |    `@username`    |    `Date`    |

<!-- Try to partner people in similar timezones -->

#### Day 3 Async Tasks are due by `Add Date and Time`. When you’ve completed these steps, please mark this [issue comment](issue comment link) with a green check and your interview is scheduled with an internal team member. :white_check_mark: 

Refer to this chart to see due dates in specific timezones. :point_down:

## Day 3 Sync Activities - Tuesday June 13th

### Hallway Testing

It is always a good idea to get feedback early on rather than later. Hallway testing allows us to get a read on whether there are any major red flags.					 					

**What is Hallway Testing?**

A fast & informal way to test ideas, get high-level feedback and identify major red flags very early on in the design process. Random participants, from people in coffee shops or malls to employees (ie. those passing by in the hallway). Optimal time is 10-15 minutes maximum (participants will lose interest after).	

**Define an Objective:**

- Your research objective sets the expectation for what you’d like to learn from doing hallway testing with your prototype.
- A research objective is defined as:
     - What you want to learn from your test.
     - Who you want to learn it from.
     - Why you want to learn about this topic. 
     - The decisions you will make as a result.

**Write a test Scenario:**

- Create a simple scenario for your hallway test. This will set the stage for your participant to use the prototype and complete a set of tasks.

**Write Test Questions:**

- Craft a list of questions and / or tasks that you’ll ask participants to answer or complete in order to answer your research objectives.

**The Testing:**

The testing will take place after the sync session at a time that makes sense for the partnered groups. 

- Working in groups of 2, review the discussion guide and prototype.
- Determine who will ask questions and who will take notes. Remember to switch roles after each test!
- It’s up to you where you take notes. 
- Join the Zoom meeting with your assigned person & test your prototype.
- Have the team document what they hear and be prepared to share back with the larger sprint team.
