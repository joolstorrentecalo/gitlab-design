## Welcome to the Design Sprint

A Design Sprint is a four-day process for solving big problems through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. 
A method for developing a hypothesis, prototyping an idea, and testing it rapidly with as little investment as possible, in as real of an environment as possible. Design Sprints quickly align teams under a shared vision. 

Jake Knapp created the Design Sprint process at Google in 2010 building products like Gmail and Hangouts. From 2010-12 at Google, Jake refined the Design Sprint with teams like Chrome, Search, and Google X.

### Homework Task: Watch Kickoff Video

Watch the [Kickoff Video](video link) or review the [Slide Deck](slide deck link) to become more familiar with Design Sprints and what to expect over the next few days.

### Q&A

Have any questions? You can ask them in the [Q&A Thread](thread link) below or in our [Slack Channel](slack channel link). 

### Homework Task: Lightning Talks and Expert Interviews

Over the next few days, you will receive a Google Form. Within the form is more information about Lightning talks and Expert interviews, but here are the basics: 

Each participant is asked to prepare a short video (5 minutes max) to talk about `The Problem` from their own perspective. This will be a video where you record your screen and audio to be presented back to the team async. These videos will act as inspiration for the team as the Sprint progresses through the design concept-ideation phases. Participants will use them as a resource, checking back with them as necessary - inspiration!

Some topics you can cover in the video are:

   - Problems you see in the `Problem Area`.
   - The state of the technology, what is happening in the field, and how you envision the future.
   - Companies or implementations that inspire you (Specific to the Sprint focus).
   - Demo walkthrough that goes through a competitor experience and functionality you find interesting or spot on.

#### Kickoff Tasks are due by `<Add Date and Time>`. When you’ve completed these steps, please mark this [issue comment](issue comment link) with a green check and add your video to the following [Google Drive](google drive link). ✅

Refer to this chart to see due dates in specific timezones. :point_down:
